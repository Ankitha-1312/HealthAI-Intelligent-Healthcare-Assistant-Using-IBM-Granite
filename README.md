# 🩺 HealthAI: Intelligent Healthcare Assistant Using IBM Granite

HealthAI is a responsive, AI-powered healthcare assistant built using Vite + React + Tailwind CSS. It enables users to describe symptoms in natural language and receive AI-driven medical insights, predicted conditions, and treatment suggestions — all powered by IBM Granite LLM.

Whether you're a patient seeking quick answers or a developer experimenting with health tech interfaces, HealthAI delivers a smart, conversational experience for symptom analysis and early diagnosis.
